\begin{document}
The overarching goal of this project is to design an algorithm to study the process of vector boson fusion (VBF) during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. The purpose of studying the VBF process is to better understand the Higgs Boson and its interactions with other fundamental particles via the Yukawa coupling. The algorithm designed in this project will be based on machine learning techniques, and will require vast amounts of monte-carlo data to train the algorithm over. Training over such large data sets will necessitate the use of highly efficient parallel computing over SLAC's distributed system cluster. As an added measure to heighten the efficiency of the algorithm, it will be developed with direct input from a prototype particle detector instrument, ALTIROC1, which provides high resolution timing information and is the predecessor to the High Granularity Timing Detector that will be installed in ATLAS during Phase-II upgrades.
