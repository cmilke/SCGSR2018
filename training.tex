This research project provides training and experience across a wide range of skillsets. At the hardware level, my work with testing and providing feedback to the ALTIROC1 project will provide experience with detector hardware and firmware design. Through the primary goal of the project, development of a machine learning algorithm, I will gain a much better understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithm design in general. And at the high-level end of the project, my research into vector boson fusion will help progress my knowledge of high-energy physics processes and analysis. Overall, perhaps the most valuable training to gain from this research will be in learning how each of these aspects of the project - hardware, software, and theory - all feed into and inform each other.
