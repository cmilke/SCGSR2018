\begin{document}
An analysis of ATLAS Run 2 data at 140 inverse femtobarns is conducted in order to better probe the Higgs coupling to quarks. The Higgs is studied using the process of vector boson fusion into a pair of quark jets, which accounts for the dominant decay mode of the Higgs. Traditionally, the vector boson fusion production mechanism has been a difficult one to study, as its primary signature is a number of jets. In this analysis however, we use a novel machine learning algorithm technique to identify VBF processes. The algorithm is informed by a high-level theoretical understanding of the VBF process, allowing for much more efficient training and selection.
