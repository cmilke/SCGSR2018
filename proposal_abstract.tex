We propose a machine learning-based algorithm to more efficiently identify the process of Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) within the ATLAS experiment. This project would utilize a novel high-level understanding of VBF physics to guide the algorithm's training, such that instead of being trained to identify the VBF process in its entirety, the algorithm is trained to identify key features that we know the process to exhibit. We intend to bolster this algorithm with information from an in-development instrument called the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD). The HGTD provides high resolution timing information of vertices, allowing tracks and jets to be reconstructed much more reliably in the face of pileup. As SLAC is currently developing a prototype to the HGTD, called ALTIROC1, it is ideally suited to host this project. The VBF algorithm can be designed using physical data from the HGTD prototype, and the algorithm's development can act as a testing ground for ALTIROC1. As well, SLAC is host to world leading experts in the applications of machine learning to physics, and posses a vast suite of GPU clusters on which to perform algorithm training. Finally, our hope for this project would be that the techniques used in designing this algorithm could be applied to more complex analyses in the future, and that the feedback provided on ALTIROC1 will make for a more efficient final design of the HGTD.
